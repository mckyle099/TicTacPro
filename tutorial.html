  <h1> Intro </h1>
   You begin the game with a function defined in the text area called getMove.<br>
       This is a very simple function that loops from 1 to 9 looking for the first square that hasn't been chosen yet. <br>
	   It is meant to show how to check the board squares for X, O, and empty.<br>
	   Every time it is your AIs turn to play, your getMove function will be called, which should return a number between 1 and 9 that hasn't been taken yet
  <h1> So how do I make it better? </h1>
   You can define an "order" of moves to play by doing something like this:<br>
  <code><br>
function getMove(board)<br>
&nbsp if board[1] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 1<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[9] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp return 9<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[3] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 3<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[7] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 7<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[8] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 8<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[2] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 2<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[6] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 6<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[4] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 4<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if board[5] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 5<br>
&nbsp end<br>
end<br>
  </code><br>
But this is a very boring "static" solution, we can do better by making decisions more dynamically.<br>
<h1>Check if we have a winning move</h1>
  The first thing you probably want to do is check if you have any moves that will win the game. It's a good idea to define a function that will do this for us.<br>
  Let's call this function isWinningMove and let's pass it the board and a position as parameters<br><br>
<code>
function isWinningMove(board, pos)<br>
<br>
end<br>
</code><br>
Now we need to fill it in. We can temporarily set the board at pos to our symbol<br><br>
<code>
function isWinningMove(board, pos)<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = 'X'<br>
end<br>
</code><br>
Note that this assumes we're playing as X. The game doesn't tell us what symbol we're playing as. A good AI should be able to play as either X or O. Can you figure out a way to programmatically
determine which symbol your AI is playing as?
<label for="hints">Hint</label>
<select name="hints" id="cars">
  <option value="blank"></option>
  <option value="hint">Even/Odd number of played squares</option>
</select>

Now that we've temporarily assigned our symbol to the board at the given position, we just need to check if we've won.
There's only 8 ways to win in TicTacToe, so we won't bother being smart about it<br><br>
<code>
function isWinningMove(board, pos)<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = 'X'<br>
&nbsp if (board[0] == board[1] and board[1] == board[2]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[4] and board[4] == board[5]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[6] == board[7] and board[7] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[4] and board[4] == board[7]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[2] == board[5] and board[5] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[6] and board[6] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[5] and board[5] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[5] and board[5] == board[7])<br>
&nbsp then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return true<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp return false<br>
end<br>
</code><br>

We've made a mistake, do you know what it is? We set the board[pos] to 'X', but we didn't unset it. Lua passes arrays (our board) by reference instead of by value, so once
this function returns, the board is changed in the calling function as well. We need to undo our change. <br><br>
<code>
function isWinningMove(board, pos)<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = 'X'<br>
&nbsp if (board[0] == board[1] and board[1] == board[2]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[4] and board[4] == board[5]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[6] == board[7] and board[7] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[4] and board[4] == board[7]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[2] == board[5] and board[5] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[6] and board[6] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[5] and board[5] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[5] and board[5] == board[7])<br>
&nbsp then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp board[pos] = '\0'<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return true<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = '\0'<br>
&nbsp return false<br>
end<br>
</code><br>

Now we have a function that can check if a move is winning or not, so we should call it from our getMove function. We only want to call it on empty squares though.<br><br>
<code>
function getMove(board)<br>
&nbsp for i=1,9 do<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if board[i] == '\0' and isWinningMove(board, i) then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return i<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp end<br>
end<br>
</code><br>

Note that we still need to add logic to select a square if there isn't a winning move.<br>
Overall, our AI should now look something like:<br><br>

<code>
function isWinningMove(board, pos)<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = 'X'<br>
&nbsp if (board[0] == board[1] and board[1] == board[2]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[4] and board[4] == board[5]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[6] == board[7] and board[7] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[4] and board[4] == board[7]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[2] == board[5] and board[5] == board[8]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[6] and board[6] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[1] == board[5] and board[5] == board[9]) or<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (board[3] == board[5] and board[5] == board[7])<br>
&nbsp then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp board[pos] = '\0'<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return true<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp board[pos] = '\0'<br>
&nbsp return false<br>
end<br>
<br>

function getMove(board)<br>
&nbsp for i=1,9 do<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if board[i] == '\0' and isWinningMove(board, i) then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return i<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp for i=1,9 do<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if board[i] == '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return i<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp end<br>
end<br>
</code><br>
It's still not that smart, but it's at least a bit smarter. The next thing you probably want to do is to check if the opponent is 1 move away from winning, and if so, block them.
