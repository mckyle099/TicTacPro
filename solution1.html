If we're called first, there will be 0 (even number) squares played, and we are X<br>
If we're called second, there will be 1 (odd number) square played, and we are O<br>
If we're called third, there will be 2 (even number) squares played, and we are X<br>
...etc<br>
As you can see, for any given turn, if there's an even number of squares played, we're X, otherwise we're O<br>

  <code><br>
function getSymbol(board)<br>
&nbsp count = 0<br>
&nbsp for i=1,9 do<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if board[i] != '\0' then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp count = count + 1<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp end<br>
&nbsp if count % 2 == 0 then<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 'X'<br>
&nbsp else<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return 'O'<br>
&nbsp end<br>
end<br>
  </code><br>
We use the modulo operator (%) to divide by 2 and check for remainder.
