  <h1> What is this? </h1>
  <h4> This is a game where you write your own AI to play TicTacToe. </h4><br>
  <h1> What is the difference between TicTacToe and TicTacPro game modes? </h1>
  <h4> TicTacToe is the traditional game where X goes first. </h4>
  <h4> In TicTacPro both players (AIs in this case) play their moves at the same time. If they both choose the same square it becomes "dead" (denoted with a -) and cannot be used to win. </h4><br>
  <h1> How do I play? </h1>
  <h4> You need to fill out the getMove function to return a number between 1 and 9. </h4><br>
